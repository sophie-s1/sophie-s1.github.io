<p>I am writing to express concerns over the motion regarding Records of transgender patients being voted on tomorrow at the LMC conference; I feel that mandating recording sex assigned at birth as the patient's sex on NHS records poses risks to patient privacy, by outing them as trans when not medically necessary, and also has the potential to impact patients treatment negatively.</p>
<p>I think it is vital to consider that biological sex, like most things in biology, is not a clean binary, and the process of medically transitioning changes a person's biology; for example, a trans woman on HRT is in many regards biochemically closer to a cis woman than a cis man thus the trans woman being recorded as a male could cause unnecessary confusion on things like blood tests if the test is analysed with regards to male reference ranges.</p>
<p>Another argument in the proposal is that changing a patient's recorded sex excludes them from receiving sex-specific screening; however, this crucially fails to recognise that mechanisms to accommodate this already exist as PCSE opts trans patients into the relevant screening programs as part of the process of issuing a new NHS number.</p>
<p>Finally, I feel that section 19c is effectively calling on the UK government for legal protection to be rude; whilst I recognise that it may be relevant to acknowledge a patient is trans, the section is worded in such a way that suggests it is intended to allow practitioners to deliberately misgender patients on the grounds of it somehow being medically necessary to do so. It goes without saying that this would create a hostile environment for trans patients.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I, as a trans person, feel that the proposal, while featuring some desirable points, such as recording patient pronouns and titles independent of sex, would overall negatively impact the dignity and healthcare of trans patients by discounting the nuances of biological sex and outing us as trans to staff when not medically necessary.</p>
